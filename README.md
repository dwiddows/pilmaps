# pilmaps
Tools for making maps using python imaging library. Made with Natural Earth. Free vector and raster map data @ naturalearthdata.com.

Projections are typically orthogonal (see map_frame.py). 

Near the equator, e.g., for maps of Southeast Asia, small maps can be rendered quite well by just treating latitude and longitude as rectilinear coordinates.
